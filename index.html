            <p>
                Hello! My name is Mario Brino I'm a Full Stack Developer. I like to work with PHP, JavaScript, and Python. I have been working with interesting technologies and solutions that allow me to be a more dedicated professional in different areas of computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been working with Laravel and Vanilla Python for backend development, these are interesting programming languages that serve to different purposes. I've worked with Vue.js, React.js, and Next.js JavaScript frameworks for frontend development.
            </p>
            <p>
                When working on frontend I'm interested on Vue.js, React.js, and Next.js, because these frameworks are powerful and give you reactivity with flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have interests with local and cloud infrastructure, since I have worked with IT for a couple of year. This allowed me to learn a little of Linux and Windows environments, along with interested solutions and features that each operating system offers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I have been working with Docker and Kubernetes that are really interesting solutions to scale projects and services.
            </p>
