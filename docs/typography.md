# Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing. It involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space within letters pairs (kerning).

## Common Types of Fonts

- Serif: Fonts with small lines or decorative strokes at the ends of letters. They are often used in print for their readability.
- Sans-serif: Fonts without the decorative strokes. They are commonly used for digital content due to their clean and modern look.
- Monospace: Fonts where each character takes up the same amount of horizontal space. They are often used in coding and programming environments.
- Display: Fonts designed for large headings or titles. They are often more decorative and less readable in long texts.
- Script: Fonts that mimic handwriting. They are often used for invitations or decorative purposes.
- Blackletter: Fonts that resemble traditional calligraphy or Gothic script. They are often used for formal documents or decorative headings.
- All Caps: Fonts where all letters are capitalized. They are often used for emphasis or to create a bold statement.
- Plain Fancy: Fonts that have a decorative or artistic style but are still legible. They are often used for branding or creative projects.

## Readability

Readability is crucial in typography. It refers to how easily a reader can understand the text. Factors that affect readability include font size, line length, spacing, and contrast between text and background.

## Combining Fonts

Combining fonts can create visual interest and hierarchy in your design. Here are some tips for effective font combinations:
- Pair a serif font with a sans-serif font for contrast.
- Use a display font for headings and a simple sans-serif font for body text.
- Avoid using too many different fonts in one design; stick to two or three complementary fonts.

## Hierarchy

Hierarchy in typography refers to the arrangement of text elements to guide the reader's attention. It helps to establish a clear structure and flow in the content. Common techniques include using different font sizes, weights, and styles to differentiate headings, subheadings, and body text.

## Tracking

Tracking refers to the overall spacing between characters in a word or line of text. Adjusting tracking can improve readability and create a more visually appealing layout. Increasing tracking can make text more legible, while decreasing it can create a denser appearance.

## Kerning

Kerning is the adjustment of space between individual characters in a word. Proper kerning ensures that letters are evenly spaced and visually balanced, enhancing readability. It is especially important in display fonts where letter shapes may vary significantly.

**BAD KERNING:** makes font look awkward and hard to read.
