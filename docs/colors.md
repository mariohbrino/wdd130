# Color Theory

Color theory is a set of principles used to understand how colors interact with each other. It is essential for artists, designers, and anyone working with color in their projects.

## Color Wheel
The color wheel is a circular diagram that represents the relationships between different colors. It is a useful tool for understanding color harmony and creating color schemes.

## Formulas
- Monochromatic: uses variations in lightness and saturation of a single color.
- Analogous: uses colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.
- Complementary: uses colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel.
- Split-complementary: uses a base color and two colors adjacent to its complementary color.
- Triadic: uses three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.
- Tetradic: uses four colors that are two complementary color pairs, recommending one color to dominate.

## Does and Don'ts
- Do use a color wheel to find harmonious color combinations.
- Do consider the psychological effects of colors in your design.
- Do experiment with different shades and tints of colors.
- Don't have too many contrasting colors in one design.
- Don't use clashing colors that create visual tension.
- Don't rely solely on color theory; trust your instincts and experiment with different color palettes.

## Readability

Readability is crucial in design, especially when using color. Ensure that text contrasts well with the background color to maintain legibility. Use high contrast between text and background colors, and avoid using colors that are too similar in hue or saturation.

Legibility can be improved by using dark text on a light background or vice versa. Additionally, consider the accessibility of your color choices for individuals with color vision deficiencies. Adding colors that are distinguishable for those with color blindness can enhance the overall usability of your design.

## Tones

Tones are created by adding gray to a color, which reduces its saturation and creates a more muted, subtle version of the original hue. This can be useful for creating a sense of depth and dimension in your designs.
